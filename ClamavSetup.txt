ClamAV Setup and Configuration Instructions
Step 1: Install ClamAV
    Run the Installer:
    Double-click on the clamav file you downloaded.
    Follow the on-screen instructions to install ClamAV.
    Install it in the default location (C:\Program Files\ClamAV\) 
    unless you need to choose a different directory.
    Finish the installation.

Step 2: Configure ClamAV
    After installation, you need to configure the virus database 
    updater (freshclam) and the virus scanner (clamd).

    Open PowerShell as Administrator:
        Press Win + X and choose Windows PowerShell (Admin).

Navigate to the ClamAV Directory:
    In the PowerShell terminal, navigate to the ClamAV installation
    directory:
        cd "C:\Program Files\ClamAV"

Copy Configuration Files:
    You need to copy the example configuration files to make them active.
    Run these commands in PowerShell
        copy .\conf_examples\freshclam.conf.sample .\freshclam.conf
        copy .\conf_examples\clamd.conf.sample .\clamd.conf

Step 3: Edit freshclam.conf
    The freshclam.conf file is responsible for managing virus signature 
    updates.
    Open freshclam.conf in a text editor:
        In PowerShell, run:
        write.exe .\freshclam.conf
    Remove the Example Line:
        Find the line that says Example and delete it. This activates the 
        configuration file.
    Optional Configurations:
        You can add optional settings, such as:
            Maximum attempts to download updates
                MaxAttempts 3
            Timeout for receiving updates
                ReceiveTimeout 60
    Save and Close the file.

Step 4: Edit clamd.conf
    The clamd.conf file is responsible for configuring the ClamAV daemon (clamd), 
    which handles virus scanning.
        Open clamd.conf in a text editor:
            In PowerShell, run
            write.exe .\clamd.conf
    Remove the Example Line:
        Find the line that says Example and delete it. This activates the 
        configuration file.
    Optional Configurations:
        You can enable logging or set the database directory:
            Enable logging
                LogFile C:\Program Files\ClamAV\clamd.log
            Set the virus database directory (if not using the default)
                DatabaseDirectory "C:\Program Files\ClamAV\database"
    Save and Close the file.

Step 5: Download Virus Signatures Using freshclam
    Now that ClamAV is configured, you need to download the virus signature database 
    using freshclam.
    Run freshclam:
        In the same PowerShell window, run the following command to download the virus 
        definitions:
            .\freshclam.exe
    Wait for the Download:
        freshclam will connect to the ClamAV servers and download the virus database 
        files into C:\Program Files\ClamAV\database
    Verify the Download:
        After the download completes, navigate to C:\Program Files\ClamAV\database to 
        verify that files like main.cvd, daily.cvd, and bytecode.cvd were successfully 
        downloaded.

Step 6: Run a Test Virus Scan
    After the virus database is installed, you can run a test virus scan to ensure 
    everything is working.
    Navigate to the ClamAV Directory:
        In PowerShell, ensure you are in the ClamAV directory:
            cd "C:\Program Files\ClamAV"
    Run a Test Scan:
        Use clamscan to scan a file or directory:
            .\clamscan.exe C:\path\to\your\file_or_directory
    Review the Results:
        ClamAV will scan the specified file or directory and display whether any 
        threats were detected.

Step 7: Automate Virus Signature Updates (Optional)
    To keep your virus signature database up to date, you can automate freshclam 
    using Task Scheduler.
    Open Task Scheduler:
        Press Win + S and type "Task Scheduler" to open it.
    Create a New Task:
        Click Create Basic Task on the right side.
        Name the task something like "ClamAV Virus Database Update."
    Set the Task Trigger:
        Set the trigger to run daily (or at your preferred frequency).
    Set the Action:
        Choose Start a Program and point it to freshclam.exe in C:\Program Files\ClamAV
    Finish:
        Finish the task creation. This will ensure that freshclam runs regularly to 
        keep your virus signatures up to date.

Summary of Commands
